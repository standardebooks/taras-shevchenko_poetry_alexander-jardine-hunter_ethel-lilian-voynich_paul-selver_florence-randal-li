			<h2 epub:type="title">The Night of Taras</h2>
			<p>
				<span>By the road the <i xml:lang="uk-Latn">Kobzar</i> sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on his <i xml:lang="uk-Latn">kobza</i> played.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around him youths and maidens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like poppy flowers arrayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So the <i xml:lang="uk-Latn">Kobzar</i> played and sang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of many an old old story;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of wars with Russian, Pole and Tartar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the ancient Cossack glory.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He sang of the wars of Taras brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of battle fought in the morning early,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the fallen Cossack’s grass-grown grave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till smiles and tears did mingle fairly.</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>“Once on a time the Hetmans ruled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">It comes not back again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In olden days we masters were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">This never comes again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These glories of old Cossack lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall be forgotten nevermore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Ukraine, Ukraine!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Mother mine. Mother mine!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">When I remember thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">How mournful should I be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What has come of our Cossacks bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">With coats of velvet red?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What of freedom by fate foretold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And banners the Hetmans led?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Whither is it gone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In flames it went:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er hills and tombs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The floods were sent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hills are wrapt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">in silence grim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On boundless sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">waves ever play;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tombs gleam forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">with sadness dim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er all the land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">the foe holds sway.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Play on, oh sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Hills silent be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dance, mighty wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">O’er all the land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weep, Cossack youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Your fate withstand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now who shall our adviser be?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then out spake Naleweiko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A Cossack bold was he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After him Paulioha</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like falcon swift did flee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Out spake Taras Traselo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With bitter words and true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That they trampled on Ukraina</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For sure the Poles shall rue.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out spake Taras Traselo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out spake the eagle grey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rescue for the faith he wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well indeed the Poles he taught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Let’s make an end of our woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An end come now to your woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arise, my gentle comrades, all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the Poles with blows we’ll fall.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Three days of war</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">did the land deliver.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the Delta’s shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">to Trubail’s river.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fields are covered</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">with dead, in course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But weary now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">is the Cossack force.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the dirty Polish ruler</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was feeling very jolly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathered all his lords together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For a time of feast and folly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taras did his Cossacks gather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To have a little talk together.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Captains and comrades,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My children and brothers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What are we now to do?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our hated foes are feasting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I want advice from you.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Let them feast away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">It’s fine for their health.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the sun descends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old night her counsel lends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cossacks’ll catch them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">and all of their wealth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sun reclined beyond the hill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stars shone out in silence still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around the Poles the Cossack host</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was gathering like a cloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So soon the moon stood in the sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When roared the cannon loud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Woke up the Polish lordlings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To run they found no place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woke up the Polish lordlings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The foe they could not face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sun beheld the Polish lordlings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In heaps all o’er the place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With red serpent on the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>River Alta brings the word⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That black vultures after slaughter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May feast on many a Polish lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now the vultures hasten</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mighty dead to waken.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together the Cossacks gather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Praise to God to offer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While black vultures scream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the corpses fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the Cossacks sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hymn to the night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That night of famous story</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of blood and glory.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That night that put the Poles to sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The while on them their foes did creep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beyond the stream</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">in open field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A burial mound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">gleams darkly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the Cossack blood was shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There grows the grass full greenly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the tomb a raven sits:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hunger sore he’s screaming.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waiting near a Cossack weeps:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of days of old he’s dreaming.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The <i xml:lang="uk-Latn">Kobzar</i> ceased in sadness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hands would no longer play:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around him youths and maidens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were wiping the tears away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the path the <i xml:lang="uk-Latn">Kobzar</i> makes his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To get rid of his grief he starts to play.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now the youngsters are dancing gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then he opes his lips to say:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Skip off, my children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To some nice warm corner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of griefs enough;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ll no longer be mourner.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To the bar I’ll go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">and find my good wife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there we’ll have</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">the time of our life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For so we’ll drink away our woes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make no end of fun of our foes.”</span>

				<span>Listen:</span>

			<p>
				<span class="i1">With a Cossack</span>

				<span class="i1">Good luck and bad luck lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On either side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there, somewhere,</span>

				<span class="i1">My lover roams the fields.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I weep, my years pass by</span>

				<span class="i1">Waiting for him.</span>

				<span class="i1">If he do not come soon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mother herself</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wishes to bury me.⁠ ⁠…</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Look far, <span xml:lang="uk-Latn">Topolia</span>, and, if he is not,</span>

				<span class="i1">Weep with the dew at sundown,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Float, float, O Swan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the bluish sea.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such a song <span xml:lang="uk-Latn">Tchornobriva</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang on the steppes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O <i xml:lang="uk-Latn">Zilie</i> Miracle!⁠—she is <span xml:lang="uk-Latn">Topolia</span>!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She did not return home;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She did not wait for him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There slim and tall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She beckons to the clouds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wind blows through the oaks in the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It dances through the fields.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside the high road it uproots <span xml:lang="uk-Latn">Topolia</span>,</span>

				<span class="i1">And fells her to the ground.</span>

				<span class="i1">“Oh breeze there is none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor do the waters run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From our Ukraina’s land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perhaps, in council there they stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To march against the Turk demand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We hear not in this foreign land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blow winds, blow across the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bring tidings of our land so free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Come from Dnieper’s Delta low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dry our tears and chase away our woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">Roar in play thou sea so blue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In yon boats are Cossacks true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their caps above are dimly seen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rescue for us this may mean.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Once more we’ll hear Ukraina’s story.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Once more the ancient Cossack glory</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We’ll hear before we die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So in Skutari the Cossacks sang,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their tears rolled down, their wailing rang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bosphorus groaned at the Cossack cry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then he raised his waves on high.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shivering like a great grey bull,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His waters roaring far and full</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the Black Sea’s ribs were hurled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sea sent on great Bosphorus’ cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To where the sands of the Delta lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then the waters of Dnieper pale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In turn took up the mournful tale.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The father Dnieper rears his crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shakes the foam from off his breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With laughter now aloud he calls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To spirits of the forest walls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Hortessa sister river, deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Time it is to wake from sleep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brother forest, sister river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come our children to deliver.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now the Dnieper is clad with boats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cossack song o’er the water floats.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i3">“In Turkey over there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Are wealth and riches rare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Hey, hey, blue sea play.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Then roar upon the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Bringing with you guests so gay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i3">“This Turkey has in her pockets</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Dollars and ducats.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">We don’t come pockets to pick,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Fire and sword will do the trick.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">We mean to free our brothers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i3">“There the janissary crouches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">There are pashas on soft couches.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Hey-ho, foemen ware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">For nothing do we care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Ours are liberty and glory.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">On they sail a-singing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The sea to the wind gives heed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In foremost boat the helm a-guiding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Brave Hamaleia takes the lead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Oh, Hamaleia, our hearts are fainting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Behold the sea in madness raving.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">“Don’t fear,” he says, “these spurting fountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">We’ll hide behind the water mountains.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All slumber in the harem,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Byzantium’s paradise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skutari sleeps, but Bosphorus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In madness shouts, “Arise!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Awake Byzantium!” it roars and groans.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Awake them not, Oh Bosphorus.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Replies the sea in thunder tones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If thou dost I’ll fill thy ribs with sand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bury thee in mud, change thee to solid land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perhaps thou knowest not the guest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I bring to break the sultan’s rest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So the sea insisted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he loved the brave Slavonic band;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Bosphorus desisted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While in slumber lay the Turkish land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lazy Sultan in his harem slept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But only in Skutari the weary pris’ners wept.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For something are they waiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To God from dungeon praying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the waves go roaring by.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh, loved God of Ukraine’s land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To us in prison stretch thy hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slaves are we a Cossack band.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shame it is now in truth to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shame it will be at judgment day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For us from foreign tomb to rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at thy court, to the world’s surprise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Show Cossack hands in chains.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i7">“Strike and kill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now the infidels will get their fill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death to the unbelievers all.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How they scream beyond the wall!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They’ve heard of Hamaleia’s fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skutari maddens at his name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Strike on,” he shouts, “kill and slay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the castle break your way.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the guns of Skutari roar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The foes in frenzy onward pour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cossacks rush with panting breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The janissaries fall in death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Hamaleia in Skutari</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Dances through the flames in glee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To the jail his way he makes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Through the prison doors he breaks.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Off the feet the fetters takes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Fly away my birds so gray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In the town to share the prey.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">But the falcons trembled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Nor their fears dissembled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">So long they had not heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">A single christian word.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Night herself was frightened.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">No flames her darkness lightened.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The old mother could not see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">How the Cossacks pay their fee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Fear not! Look ahead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To the Cossack banquet spread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Dark over all, like a common day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And this no little holiday.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“No sneak thieves with Hamaleia,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To eat their bacon silently</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Without a frying pan.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Let’s have a light,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Now burning bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To heaven flames Skutari,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">With all its ruined navy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Byzantium awakes, its eyes it opens wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With grinding teeth hastes to its comrade’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Byzantium roars and rages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hands to the shore it reaches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From waters gasping strives to rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then with sword in heart it dies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With fires of hell Skutari’s burning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bazaars with streams of blood are churning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broad Bosphorus pours in its waves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like blackbirds in a bush</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cossacks fiercely rush.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No living soul escapes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Untouched by fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They the walls down tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silver and gold in their caps they bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And load their boats with riches rare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Burns Skutari, ends the fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The warriors gather and come away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their pipes with burning cinders light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And row their boats through waves flame bright.</span>

				<span>On Sunday she did not dance⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She earned the money for her skeins of silk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With which she embroidered her kerchief.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while she stitched she sang:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">“My kerchief, embroidered, stitched, and scalloped!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I shall present thee and my lover shall kiss me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O <i xml:lang="uk-Latn">Khustina</i>, bright with my painting.</span>

				<span class="i1">Fine-broidered and painted kerchief.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So worked she at her stitching, and gazed down the road</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To listen for the bellowing of the curved-horned oxen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see if her <i xml:lang="uk-Latn">Tchumak</i> comes homeward.</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>The <i xml:lang="uk-Latn">Tchumak</i> is coming from beyond Lyman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With another’s possessions, with no luck of his own.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He drives another man’s oxen; he sings as he drives:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">“O my fate, my fortune,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why is it not like that of others?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Do I drink and dance?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have I not got strength?</span>

			<p>
				<span>And as he journeyed over the steppes, lonesome, unhappy, he wept⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And out on the steppes, on a grave, a grey owl hooted.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The <i xml:lang="uk-Latn">Tchumaki</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a> greatly troubled, entreated:</span>

				<br/>
				<span>That there he may confess ere death; be shriven.”</span>

				<span>They confessed; heard mass, consulted fortune-tellers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But it availed not; so with him, unholpen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They moved along the road. Was it his burden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The constant burden of his anxious love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Or victim he of some one’s evil spell?),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That so they brought him from the Don</span>

				<span>God he besought</span>

				<span>At least to see his sweetheart. But not so⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He pleaded not enough.⁠ ⁠… They buried him⁠ ⁠…</span>

				<p>
					<span>On a Sunday, very early,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When fields were clad with mist</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A woman’s form was bending</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Mid graves by cloud wreaths kissed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Something to her heart she pressed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In accents low the clouds addressed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Oh, you mist and raindrops fine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pity this ragged luck of mine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hide me here in grassy meadows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bury me beneath thy shadows.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why must I ’mid sorrows stray?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pray take them with my life away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In gloomy death would be relief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where none might know or see my grief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet not alone my life was spent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A father and mother my sin lament.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor yet alone is my course to run</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in my arms is my little son.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall I, then, give to him christian name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To poverty bind, with his mother’s shame?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This, brother mist, I shall not do.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I alone my fault must rue.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee, sweet son, shall strangers christen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy mother’s eyes with teardrops glisten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy very name I may not know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As on through life I lonely go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I, by my sin, rich fortune lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With thee, my son, to ill fate, was tossed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet curse me not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">for evils past.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My prayers to heaven</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">shall reach at last.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The skies above</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">to my tears shall bend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another fortune to thee I’ll send.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the fields she sobbing went.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gentle mist</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">its shelter lent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her tears were falling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">the path along,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As she softly sang</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">the widows song:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Oh, in the field there is a grave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the shining grasses wave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There the widow walked apart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bitter sorrow in her heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Poison herbs in vain she sought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereby evil spells are wrought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two little sons</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">in arms she bore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wrapped around in</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">dress she wore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her children to the river carried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In converse with the water tarried;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Oh, river Dunai, gentle river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I my sons to thee deliver,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou’lt swaddle them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">and wrap them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy little waves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">will lap them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy yellow sands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">will cherish them,</span>

					<span>One fine Sunday,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">in the bright sunlight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All dressed up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">in blouses white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The old folks sat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">on the bench by the door;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No cloud in sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">What could they ask more?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All peace and love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">it seemed like Eden.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet angels above</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">their hearts might read in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A hidden sorrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">a gloomy mood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like lurking beast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">in darksome wood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In such a heaven</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Oh, do you see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whatever could</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">the trouble be?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wonder now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">what ancient sorrow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suddenly sprang</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">into their morrow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was it quarrel</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">of yesterday</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Choked off, then</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">revived today,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or yet some newly sprouted ire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arisen to set their heaven on fire?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Perchance they’re called to go to God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor longer dwell on earth’s green sod.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then who for them on that far way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Horses and chariot shall array?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Anastasia, wife of mine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon will come our fatal day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who will lay our bones away?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i4">“God only knows.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With me always was that thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which gloom into my heart has brought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Together in years and failing health,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For what have we gathered</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i4">“Hold a minute,</span>

					<span>Beyond the gate⁠—’tis like a child.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let’s run! See’st ought?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I thought something was there.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Together they sprang</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the gate running;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then stopped in silence wondering.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Before the stile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">a swaddled child,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not bound tightly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">just wrapped lightly,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And the mother</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">with fond caress</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had covered it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">with her own last dress.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In wondering prayer</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">stood our fond old pair.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The little thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">just seemed to plead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In little arms</span>

					<span>Its prayer⁠—</span>

					<span class="i6">in silence all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No crying⁠—just a little breath its call.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">“See, ’Stasia!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What did I tell thee?</span>

					<span>Quick, bear it inside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the village I’ll ride.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i2">In this world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">things strangely run.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">There’s a fellow</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Into lonely lands to roam,</span>

					<span>While other poor creatures,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sorrowful features,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sweat of their toiling</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Must much money earn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wage of their moiling</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Candles to burn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prayers to repeat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The saints to entreat;</span>
					<br/>

				<p>
					<span>Their joys do now such numbers reach</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God fathers and mothers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Mid lots of others</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold they have gathered</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three pairs of each.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At even they christen him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Mark is the name of him.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i2">So Mark grows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">And so it goes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For the dear old folk it is no joke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For they don’t know where to go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where to set him, when to pet him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the year goes and still Mark grows.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet they care for him, you’d scarce tell how,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just as he were a good milk-cow.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now a woman young and bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With eyebrows dark and skin so white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Comes into this blessed place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For servant’s task she asks with grace.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“What, what⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">say we’ll take her ’Stasia.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“We’ll take her, Trophimus.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We are old and little wearies us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He’s almost grown within a year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yet he’ll need more care, I fear.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Truly he’ll need care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now, praise God, I’ve done my share.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My knees are failing, so now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You poor thing, tell us your wage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is by the year or how?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“What ever you like to give.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“No, no, it’s needful to know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It’s needful, my daughter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i5">to count one’s wage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This you must learn, count what you earn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is the proverb⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who counts not his money</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hasn’t got any.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, child, how will this do?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You don’t know us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i5">We don’t know you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’ll stay with us a few days,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Get acquainted with our ways;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We’ll see you day by day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bye and bye we’ll talk of pay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is it so, daughter?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Very good, uncle.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“We invite you into the house.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And so they to agreement came.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The young woman seemed always the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cheerful and happy as she’d married a lord</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who’d buy up villages just at her word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She in the house and out doth work</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From morning light to evening’s mirk.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And yet the child is her special care;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whatever befalls, she’s the mother there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor Monday nor Sunday this mother misses</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To give its bath and its white dresses.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She plays and sings, makes wagons and things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on a holiday, plays with it all the day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Wondering, the old folks gaze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to God they give the praise.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So the servant never rests,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the night her spirit tests.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In her chamber then, I ween,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many a tear she sheds unseen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet none knows nor sees it all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the little Mark so small.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nor knows he why in hours of night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His tossings break her slumbers light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So from her couch she quickly leaps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The coverings o’er his limbs she keeps.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sign of cross the child she blesses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her gentle care her love confesses.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Each morning Mark spreads out his hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the Servant as she stands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Accepts, unknowing, a mother’s care.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only to grow is his affair.</span>

					<span>Meantime many a year has rolled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many waters to the sea have flowed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trouble to the home has come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many a tear down the cheek has run.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Poor old ’Stasia in earth they laid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hardly old Trophim’ from death they saved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cursed trouble roared so loud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then it went to sleep, I trow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the dark woods where she frightened lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Peace came back in the home to stay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i2">The little Mark is farmer now.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">With ox-teams great in the fall must go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">To far Crimea to barter there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Skins for salt and goods more rare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i2">The Servant and Trophimus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">in counsel wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Plans for his marriage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i6">now devise.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i2">Dared she her thoughts utter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">For the Czar’s daughter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">She’d send in a trice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">But the most she could say</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">While thinking this way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Was, “Ask Mark’s advice.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i2">“My daughter, we’ll ask him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">And then we’ll affiance him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">So they gave him sage advice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">And they made decision nice.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soon his grave friends about him stand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sends them to woo, a stately band.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Back they come with towels on shoulder</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere the day is many hours older.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sacred bread they have exchanged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bargain now is all arranged.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They’ve found a maiden in noble dress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A princess true, you well may guess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such a queen is in this affiance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As with a general might make alliance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hail, and well done,” the old man says,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And now let’s have no more delays.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the marriage, where the priest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What about the wedding feast?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who shall take the mother’s place?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How we’ll miss my ’Stasia’s face.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tears along his cheeks do fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet a word does the Servant’s heart appall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hastily rushing from the room,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In chamber near she falls in swoon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The house is silent, the light is dim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sorrowing Servant thinks of him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whispers: “Mother, mother, mother.”</span>

				<p>
					<span>All the week at the wedding cake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Young women in crowds both mix and bake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The old man is in wondrous glee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With all the young women dances he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At sweeping the yard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He labors hard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All passers-by on foot and horseback</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hales to the court where is no lack</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of good home-brew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All comers he asks to the marriage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet ’tis true</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He runs around so</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’d not guess from his carriage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though his joy is such a wonderful gift,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His old legs are ’most too heavy to lift.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Everywhere is disorder and laughter</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the house and in the yard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From store-room keg upon keg follows after,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Workers’ voices everywhere heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They bake, they boil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At sweeping toil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tables and floors they wash them all.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And where is the Servant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">who cares not for wage?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Kiev she is gone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">on pilgrimage.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yes, Anna went. The old man pled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mark almost wept for her to stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As mother sit, to see him wed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her call of duty elsewhere lay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“No, Mark, such honor must I not take</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To sit while you your homage make</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To parents dear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My mind is clear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A servant must not thy mother be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lest wealthy guests may laugh at thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now may God’s mercy with thee stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the saints at Kiev I go to pray.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yet again shall I return</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto your house, if you do not spurn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My strength and toil.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With pure heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">she blessed her Mark</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And weeping, passed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">beyond the gate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then the wedding blossomed out;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Work for musicians and the joyous rout</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of dancing feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While mead so sweet</span>

					<span>Of fermented honey with spices dashed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over the benches and tables splashed,</span>

					<span>Meanwhile the Servant limps along</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hastening on the weary road to Kiev.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the city come, she does not rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hires to a woman of the town;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For wages carries water.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You see she money, money needs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For prayers to Holy Barbara.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She water carries, never tarries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mighty store of pennies saves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then in the Lavra’s awesome caves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She seeks the blessed wealth she craves.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From <abbr>St.</abbr> John she buys a magic cap,</span>

					<span>For Mark she bears it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when he wears it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For never a headache need he give e’er a rap.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then <abbr>St.</abbr> Barbara gives her a ring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To her new daughter back to bring.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>’Fore all the saints</span>

				<p>
					<span>She has come back.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fair Kate with Mark makes haste to meet her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far beyond the gate they greet her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then into the house they bring her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Draw her to the table there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quickly spread with choicest fare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her news of Kiev they now request,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While Kate arranges her couch for rest.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i4">“Why do they love me,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Old Trophimus sat in garments white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the bench, in wide straw hat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All amid the sunshine bright.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before him with a little dog</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His frolicsome grandson played,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The while his little granddaughter</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was in her mother’s garb arrayed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Smiling he welcomed her as matron;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For so at “visitors” they played.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But what did you do with the visitor’s cake?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did somebody steal it in the wood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or perhaps you’ve simply forgotten to bake?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For so they talked in lightsome mood.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But see⁠—Who comes?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis their Anna at the door!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Run old and young! Who’ll come before?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Anna waits not their welcome wordy.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Is Mark at home, or still on journey?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“He’s off on journey long enough,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Says the old man in accents gruff.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With pain the Servant sadly saith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Home have I come with failing breath;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor ’mid strangers would I wait for death.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May I but live my Mark to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For something grievously weighs on me.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From little bag the children’s gifts</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She takes. There’s crosses and amulets.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Irene is of beads a string,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pictures too, and for Karpon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A nightingale to sweetly sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toy horses and a wagon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A fourth time she brings a ring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From <abbr>St.</abbr> Barbara to Katherine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Next the old man’s gift she handles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It’s just three holy waxen candles.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For Mark and herself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">she nothing brought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For want of money</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">she nothing bought.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For want of strength</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">more funds to earn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Half a bun was her wealth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">on her return.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to how to divide it</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let the babes decide it.</span>

					<span>She enters now the house so sweet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And daughter Katherine bathes her feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then sets her down to dine in state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But my Anna nor drank nor ate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i4">“Katherine!</span>

				<p>

					<span>Such as <abbr>St.</abbr> Nicholas may heed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then we must an offering pay,</span>

					<span>For Mark tarries on the way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perchance somewhere,</span>

				<p>
					<span class="i4">“Katherine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My race is run,</span>

					<span>All my earthly tasks are done.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My powers no longer I command</span>

					<span>Nor on my feet have strength to stand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet, my Kate, how can I die</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While in this dear warm home I lie?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The sickness harder grows amain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For her the sacred host’s appointed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She’s been with holy oils anointed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet nought relieves her pain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old Trophim’ in courtyard walks a-ring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Moving like a stricken thing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Katherine, for the suff’rers sake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Doth never rest for her eyelids take.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even the owls upon the roof</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of coming evil tell the proof.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The suff’rer now, each day, each hour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whispers the question, with waning power</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Daughter Katherine, is Mark yet here?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So struggle I with doubt and fear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did I but know I’d see him for sure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through all my pain I might endure.”</span>

				<p>
					<span>Now Mark comes on with the caravan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Singing blithely as he can.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the inns he makes no speed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quietly lets the oxen feed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mark brings home for Katherine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Precious cloth of substance rich;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For father dear, a girdle sewn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of silk so red.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Servant Anne</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">a gold cloth bonnet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To deck her head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">And kerchief, too</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">with white lace on it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the children are shoes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">with figs and grapes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There’s gifts for all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">there’s none escapes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all he brings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">red wine, so fine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From great old city</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">of Constantine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There’s buckets three</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">in each barrel put on.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And caviar</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">from the river Don.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such gifts he has</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">in his wagon there,</span>

					<span>Nor knows the sorrow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">his loved ones bear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On comes Mark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">knows not of worry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he’s come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Give God the glory!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gate he opens,</span>

					<span class="i4">Praising God.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Hear’st thou, Katherine?</span>

					<span>Already he’s come,</span>

					<span>Quickly bring him in to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glory to Thee, my Saviour dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the strength has come from Thee.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And she “Our Father” softly said</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just as if in dream she read.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The old man the team unyokes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lays away the carven yokes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Kate at her husband strangely looks.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Where’s Anna, Katherine?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve been careless!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She’s not dead?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i4">“No, not dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But very sick and calls for thee.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>On the threshold Mark appears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Standing there as torn by fears.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Anna whispers, “Be not afraid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glory to God, Who my fears allayed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Go forth, Katherine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">though I love you well,</span>

					<span>I’ve something to ask him,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From the place</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>While Mark his head</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">o’er the Servant bent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Mark, look at me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look at me well!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A secret now I have to tell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On this faded form</span>

					<span>No servant, I, nor Anna more,</span>

					<span>Nor yet guessed Mark</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">What was to come.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet once again her eyelids raised</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into his eyes she deeply gazed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Mid gathering tears.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I from thee forgiveness pray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve penance offered day by day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All my life to serve another.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forgive me, son, of me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I⁠—am thy mother.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She ceased to speak.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sudden faintness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Mark did take:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed the earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">itself did shake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He roused⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">and to his mother crept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the mother</span>

				<span>Cloud mountains o’er them rise,</span>

				<span>Red, red have flowed their streams and rills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’re sown with human woes and sighs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There long ago in days of old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Olympus’ Czar, the angry Jove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His wrath did pour on a hero bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On brave Prometheus, he who strove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fire of heaven to seize for men.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On mountain side, in vulture’s den</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He suffered what no mortal pen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May well indite. The savage beak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his hearts’ blood doth daily reek.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet the torn heart again revives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To triumph o’er its tortures strives.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our souls yield not to grievous ills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To freedom march our stubborn wills.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though waves of trouble o’er us roll</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The waves move not the steadfast soul.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our living spirit is not in chains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The word of God in glory reigns.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis not for us to challenge Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though life rolls on in toil and tears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though we Thy purpose cannot see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We cling to hope ’mid doubts and fears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our cause lies sunk in drunken sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When will it awaken, Lord?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oppressors gloat and patriots weep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When wilt strength to us afford?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So weary, then art Thou, Oh God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can’st life to us no longer give?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy Truth we trust beneath the rod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Believing in Thy strength we live.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our cause shall rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our freedom rise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though tyrants rage:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Thee alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All nations bow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through age on age</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet meantime</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span class="i4">they go.</span>

				<span>Beyond the hills are mightier hills,</span>

				<span>Cloud mountains o’er them rise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red, red have flowed their streams and rills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’re sown with human woes and sighs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Look at us in tender heartedness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in hunger dire and nakedness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forging freedom in unhappiness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toiling ever without blessedness.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The bones of soldiers bleaching lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In blood and tears must many die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In faith, there’s widows’ tears, I think,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all the Czars to give to drink.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then there’s tears of many a maiden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falling so soft in the lonely night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hot tears of mothers, sorrow-laden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dry tears of fathers, in grievous plight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not rivers, but a sea has flowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A burning sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all the Czars who in triumph rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their hounds and gamekeepers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their dogs and their beaters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May glory be!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To you be glory, hills of blue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All clad in monstrous chains of frost.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glory to you, ye heroes true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With God your labors are not lost.</span>

				<span>Fear not to fight, you’ll win at length,</span>

				<span>That good heart’s blood of thine so red.</span>

					<span class="i4">He’ll tell you.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That’s the way you learn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">in foreign lands.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The German says⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">“You are Mongols.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Mongols, Mongols;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Naked children</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">of the golden Tamerlane.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The German says⁠—</span>

					<span class="i2">“You are Slavs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Slavs, Slavs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ugly offspring</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">of famous ancestors.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You read the writings</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Push in among them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Get on so well</span>

					<span>Except your own⁠—God help it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Oh, as for that</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Sometime we’ll speak</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">our own language</span>

					<span>When the German</span>

					<span>They learned to speak so well</span>

					<span class="i2">That even the mighty German</span>

					<span>Not to speak of common folks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh what a noise and racket!</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Rested her head on our hills,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The far-flung Steppes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">are her garments.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! ’twas in blood she bathed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pillowed her head on burial mounds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">On bodies of Cossack freemen,</span>

					<span>You buy them from him,</span>

				<span>I count in prison the days and nights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then forget the count.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How heavily, Oh Lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do these days pass!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the years flow after them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quietly they flow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bearing with them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good and ill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everything do they gather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never do they return.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You need not plead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your prayers unanswered fall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mid oozy swamps</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">among the weeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Year after weary year</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">has sadly flowed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much of something have they taken</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From dark store-house of my heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Borne it quietly to the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As quietly the sea swallowed it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not gold and silver</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Did they take from me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But good years of mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Freighted with loneliness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sorrows written on the heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">With unseen pen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a fourth year passes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">So gently, so slowly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fourth book</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">of my imprisonment</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I start to stitch up,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Embroidering it with tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of homesickness</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">in a foreign land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet such woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">tells itself not in words.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never, never</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">in the wide world.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In far away captivity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">There are no words</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not even tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Just nothingness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not even God above thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing is there to see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None with whom to speak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not even desire for life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet thou must live!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must! I must!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">But for what?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I may not lose my soul?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My soul is not worth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">such suffering!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then why must I live on</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">in the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drag these fetters</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">in my jail?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because, perchance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">my own Ukraine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall see again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Again I shall pour out</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">my words of sorrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the green groves</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">and rich meadows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No family have I of my own</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">in all Ukraine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet the people there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">are different from these foreigners</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would walk again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">among the bright villages</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the Dnieper’s banks</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">and sing my thoughts</span>

				<span class="i4">gentle and sad.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Oh God of mercy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I may live</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">to see again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those green meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">those ancestral tombs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If Thou wilt not grant this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Yet bear my tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To my Ukraine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Because, God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I die for her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It may be that I shall lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">more lightly in foreign soil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When sometimes in Ukraine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">they speak of my memory.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carry my tears then</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Oh God of loving kindness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or at least</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">send hope into my soul.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can think no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">with my poor head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For coldness of death</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">comes on me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I think that they may</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">bury me in foreign soil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bury my thoughts with me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And none tell about me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">in the Ukraine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And yet it may be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">that gently through the years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My tear-embroidered songs</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">shall fly sometime</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">as dew upon the ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the tender heart of youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And youth shall nod assent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And weep for me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Making mention of me in its prayers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, as it will be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">so it will be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perhaps ’twill swim</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Perhaps ’twill wade</span>

				<span class="i1">’Mid lofty palace walls,</span>

				<span>Me at midnight hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Dnieper’s flood she bathed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bathing, she murmured</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Over little me:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“Swim, swim, little maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Adown the Dnieper water,</span>

				<span class="i2">You’ll swim out a fairy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Next midnight, my daughter.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">I go to dance with him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">My faithless lover;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">You’ll come and lure him</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Into the river.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">No more shall he laugh at me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">At my tears out-flowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">But o’er him the Dnieper</span>

				<span>I grew as in a dream.</span>

				<span>A week, and I dance at midnight,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>What does my sinful mother?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lives she still in shameful pleasure,</span>

				<span>With him, the faithless lord?</span>

				<span>Thus the fairy whispered,</span>

				<span>Back in the stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the willows bowed above her.</span>

				<span>’Tis weary in the palace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the lord is not at home.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She comes to the bank, thinks of her little one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom she plunged in with muttered charms.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What matters it? She would go back to the palace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But no, hers is another fate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She noticed not how the river maidens hastened</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till they caught her, and tickled her ’mid laughter.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Joyfully they caught her, and played and tickled her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And put her in a basket net</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Unto her death).</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then they roared and laughed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But one little fairy did not laugh.</span>

				<br/>
				<span>From that house Ukraina is seen,</span>

				<span>Beside the house an old gray father sits.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the river the sun goes down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he sits, and looks, and sadly thinks.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Alas, Alas!” the old man cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fools, that lost this land of God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Hetmans’ land.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His brow with thought is clouded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Something bitter he would have said</span>

				<span>But did not.</span>

			<p>
				<span>“Much have I wandered in the world,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Good God, even there it is better</span>

				<span>Than in our Ukraina.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perhaps because the Kirghiz</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are not Christians.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much evil hast thou done, Oh Christ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast changed the people God had made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our Cossacks lost their foolish heads</span>

				<span>For truth, and the Christian faith.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much blood they shed, their own and others.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And were they better for it?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bah! No! They were ten times worse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Apart from knife and auto-da-fe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have chained up the people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they kill them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh gentlemen, Christian gentlemen!”</span>

			<p>
				<span>My grey old man, with sorrow beaten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ceased, and bent his brave old head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The evening sun gilded the woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The river and fields were covered with gold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mazeppa’s cathedral in whiteness shines;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great Bogdan’s tomb is gleaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The willows bend o’er the road to Kiev,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hide the Three Brothers’ ancient graves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trubail and Alta, mid the reeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Approach, unite in sisterly embrace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everything, everything gladdens the eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the heart is sad and will not see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glowing sun has bade farewell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dark land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The round moon rises with her sister star,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out they step from behind the clouds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The clouds rejoiced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the old man gazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his tears rolled down.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I pray Thee, merciful God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mighty Lord, Heavenly Judge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suffer me not to perish;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant me strength to overcome my woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To live out my life on these sacred hills:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To glorify Thee and rejoice in Thy beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at last, though beaten by the people’s sins.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be buried on these lofty hills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to abide on them.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He dried his tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hot tears, though not the tears of youth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thought on the blessed years of long ago</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where was this?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What, how, and when?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was it truth, or was it dream?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On what seas have I been sailing?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The green wood in the twilight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The maiden with eyebrows dark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The moon at rest among the stars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The nightingale on the viburnum,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether in silence or in song</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Praising the Holy God.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all, all is in Ukraina.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The old man smiled⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, it may be⁠—you can’t avoid the truth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So it was⁠—they wooed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They parted, they did not marry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She left him to live alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To live out his life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The old man was sad again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandered long about the house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then prayed to God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went in the house to sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the moon was swathed in clouds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus in a foreign land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I dreamed my dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if born again to the world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In freedom once more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant me, Oh God, some time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In old age, perchance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stand again on these stolen hills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a little cottage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bring my heart eaten out with sorrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To rest at last, on the hills above the Dnieper.</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Though grief it brings to me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Kiev in the low countrie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came our brotherhood so free.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor slave nor lord have they,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all in noble garb so gay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came splashing forth in mood full glad</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With velvet coats the streets are clad.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They swagger in silken garments pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they for no one turn aside.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In Kiev, in the low countrie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the cossacks dance in glee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just like water in pails and tubs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wine pours out ’mid great hubbubs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wine cellars and bars</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">with all the barmaids</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cossacks have bought</span>

			<p>
				<span>The people gaze</span>

				<span class="i4">with gladsome eyes,</span>

				<span>While scholars of the cloister schools</span>

				<span>Unhappy scholars! Were they free,</span>

				<span>They would cossacks dancing be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who is this by musicians surrounded</span>

				<span>To whom the people give fame unbounded?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In trousers of velvet red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a coat that sweeps the road</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cossack comes. Let’s weep o’er his years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For what they’ve done is cause for tears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But there’s life in the old man yet I trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For with dancing kicks</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">he spurns the dust.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his short time left with men to mingle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cossack sings,</span>

			<p>
				<span class="i2">“On the road is a crab, crab, crab.</span>

				<span>To the Cloister of our Saviour</span>

				<span>After him his joyous crowd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the folk of Kiev so proud.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dances he up to the doors⁠—</span>

				<span>“Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!” he roars.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye holy monks give greeting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A comrade from the prairie meeting.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Opens the sacred door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The Cossack enters in.</span>

				<span class="i6">this old gray-hair,</span>

				<span class="i2">’Twas Semon Palee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i6">a cossack free</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Whom trouble could not quell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh in the East the sun climbs high</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sets again in the western sky.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In narrow cell in monkish gown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tramps an old man up and down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then climbs the highest turret there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To feast his eyes on Kiev so fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sitting on the parapet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He yields a while to fond regret.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anon he goes to the woodland spring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The belfry near, where sweet bells ring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cooling draught to his mind recalls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How hard was life without the walls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Again the monk his cell floor paces</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Mid the silent walls his life retraces.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sacred book he holds in hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loudly reads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The old man’s mind to Cossack land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swiftly speeds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now holy words do fade away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The monkish cell turns Cossack den,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glorious brotherhood lives again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gray old captain, like an owl</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peers beneath the monkish cowl.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Music, dances, the city’s calls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rattling fetters, Moscow’s walls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er woods and snows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">his eyes can see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The banks of distant Yenisee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his soul deep gloom has crept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus the monk in sadness wept.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">Down, Down! Bow thy head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">On thy fleshly cravings tread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">In the sacred writings read</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Read, read, to the bell give heed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Thy heart too long has ruled thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">All thy life it’s fooled thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Thy heart to exile led thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Now let it silent be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">As all things pass away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">So thou shalt pass away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Thus may’st thou know thy lot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Mankind remembers not.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though groans the old man’s sadness tell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his book he quickly fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tramped and tramped about his cell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He sits again in mood forlorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wonders why he e’er was born.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One thing alone he fain would tell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He loves his Ukraina well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">For Matins now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i7">the great bell booms.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">The aged monk</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i7">his cowl resumes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">For Ukraina now to pray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">My good old Palee limps away.</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Then, dandling him a moment</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">fell asleep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In dreams she saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">her little son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her Johnny, grown to man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">handsome and rich.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No lonely bachelor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">but a married man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In freedom it seemed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">no longer the landlord’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">but his own man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in their own joyous field</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">his wife and he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">reaped their own wheat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their children brought their food.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The poor thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">laughed in her sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woke up⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">a dream indeed it was.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She looked at Johnny,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">picked him up and swaddled him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And back to her allotted task;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sixty stooks her stint.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perhaps the last of the sixty it was:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">God grant it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And God grant</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">this dream of thine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i4">may be fulfilled.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Thy youth is over; time has brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Winter upon thee; hope is grown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chill as the north wind; thou art old.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sit thou in thy dark house alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With no man converse shalt thou hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With no man shalt take counsel; nought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nought art thou, nought be thy desire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sit still alone by thy dead fire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till hope shall mock thee, fool, again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blinding thine eyes with frosty gleams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vexing thy soul with dreams, with dreams</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like snowflakes in the empty plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sit thou alone, alone and dumb;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cry not for Spring, it will not come.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It will not enter at thy door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor make thy garden green once more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor cheer with hope thy withered age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor loose thy spirit from her cage⁠ ⁠…</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sit still, sit still! Thy life is spent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nought art thou, be with nought content.</span>
